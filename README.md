## ☕ Coffee Website Project

Hello\! This project is a **fully responsive (mobile-friendly) Coffee Website** demo that I developed with the aim of reinforcing my modern front-end development skills and practically learning the technologies used in real-world scenarios.

This work features the essential sections required for a café/coffee shop (Homepage, Menu, About, Contact) and was built purely for learning purposes.

### ✨ Project Features

  * **Mobile Responsiveness:** Seamless viewing and usability on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), achieved using CSS Media Queries.
  * **Dynamic Menu:** Implemented a Hamburger menu and an Off-Canvas Menu managed with JavaScript for mobile devices.
  * **Customer Testimonials:** A popular [Swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com/) library was used to create a scrollable testimonials section.
  * **Contact Form:** A basic contact form designed to capture user information.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

The core languages and libraries utilized in this project are:

  * **HTML5**
  * **CSS3**
  * **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**
  * **Swiper.js** (For creating the Slider/Slideshow)
